How can a list view screen have 2 xml files

Activitymain.xml
	list view tag
		Overall screen, some sort of list
		Didn't need special "row.xml" due to andoid.R.layout.simple_list_item_1

row.xml

	<ImageView
		src = "@drawable/image.png"/>


onCreate(  )  {
	
	String[] countries = {"Ireland"}

	ArrayAdapter myAdapter = new ArrayAdapter  (
		this,
		row.xml,
		R.id.textView1,
		counries
	);
}

----------------------------------

countries
write code, so goes to different activity, displays the counry, and the flag.
Intent is used to switch screens

can use a method called "putExtra()" to send key values, data, to the next activity


---
protected void onListItemClick(ListView, View v, int position, int id)  {
	
}

To capture GUI Events:
- A listener (to listen for clicks)
- put listener onto a widget wanted to listen to (set onto)
- The callback method, called when hears thing listening to

not needed when extending ListActivity, as list activity and listeners are already setup in the parent class(es)



LayoutInflater

- specific to android
- the api around are inflation
- "inflate it" want to display it graphically
- mostly done underneath, sometimes need to do it "yourself"


Array Adapter

-- 
class MyList extends ListActivity  {
	class MyAdapter extends ArrayAdapter   {
		
	}
}
