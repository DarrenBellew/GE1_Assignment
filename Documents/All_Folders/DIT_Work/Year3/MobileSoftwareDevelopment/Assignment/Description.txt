-- Idea: Unit Conversion App

Store conversion forumulaes in a SQLLite Database

-- No input boxes
User:
	First: picks the number from dropdowns, easier to control on a mobile, rather than to type
		1.1: can have optional button to toggle between EditText and a Dropdown
	Can change the conversion without the loss of data in the edittext/dropdowns
	Switch Button to swap the items in the conversio

	Can make their own conversion option and formula (Custom).


	Create multiple tabs, with menu box; slide screen to switch between each one (Similar to changing tabs in google chrome)
		(A limited amount? or unlimited?)

Custom Conversions
	Can add / remove customs
		can set custom rules for their conversions

	Conversions are also split into category, for user preference (Can toggle view)
		Eg:
			Game related
				(TF2: Ref -> Scrap; Ref -> â‚¬/$)
					1 scrap = 0.11, 1 ref = 1.00, however: 0.99 = 1.00, problem in calculation (Will need research to make this work)
			Currency
				Easily enough, however, will it be static or dynamic (Same with the TF2 metal conversions)

			Weights/Amounts
				Lt -> Ml
				pounds -> ounces -> grams -> kilograms


Tables:
	Conversion type:
		ConversionTypeID
		ConversionName

	Conversion:
		convId,
		unit1,
		unit2,
		Formula(or)Recipe,
		Rules,--maybeNot
		unitId;

	Units:
		unitId
		UnitShort

--Future additions; after assignment:
	Creatable addons, (Packages) that can be downloaded and added to the app!

Tables for app:

	Units:
		UnitID Number (5),
		UnitName VARCHAR2(50),
		CategoryId Number (5);

	Conversion:
		ConversionID Number (5),
		Unit1ID Number (5),
		Unit2ID Number (5),
		Formula VARCHAR2(50);

	Category
